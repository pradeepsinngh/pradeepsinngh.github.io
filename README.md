Source code of my personal website. Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) &  and served from [GitHub](http://github.com).

## License

Keeping the source files open so others can learn - like I learned from His Awesomeness [Zac Holman's](https://github.com/holman/holman.github.com). Fork around, learn around.

But **NOT** giving it an open source license because - hey my photos and many others things aren't open source. So all fair **use for learning & reference purposes** is good to go!
