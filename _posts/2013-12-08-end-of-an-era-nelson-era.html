<p>Last time i red about Nelson Mandela was around during my school days. Till then i have very faint memory about him.But on 5th Dec 2013 when i was glued to my books as i was having my very next exam after two days i.e 7th Dec, suddenly breaking news came on almost all news channel’s saying “END OF AN ERA : NELSON-ERA”, “Nelson Mandela passed away”,”R.I.P Nelson Mandela” and many more………</p>

<p>  That was the time when this word (Nelson) clicked in my mind and i started recollecting about him but unfortunately couldn’t able to do so,because i have never red much about him except little bit which almost all students do during their school curriculum in History subject.Don’t know, why i was very much eager to know more and more about him, and then there comes Google into the picture ( I goggled about Nelson Mandela and learnt many things about him).</p>

<p>Just like The Great Mahatma Gandhi, he was not Human being,in fact he was even much more closer or next to god.During my research of around 30-40 mins on web i can confidently say that he not only belongs to era where some of the great leader was born (Eg Mahatma Gandhi),but he also have many things in common with Mahatma Gandhi like:- </p>

<p>1. Activist.</p>
<p>2. both of these personalities fought for poor. </p>
<p>3. rights to every individuals.</p>
<p>4. dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalized racism, poverty and inequality.</p>
<p>5. fostering racial reconciliation.</p>
<p>6. Launched many campaign and movements against apartheid.</p>

    <p> During my journey of around half an hour,one things that was highlighted again and again was his will to fight against discrimination and sense of belonging towards mankind.I could easily connect to Mandela,his thoughts,vision and nature,as even i have got the taste of discrimination in one or the other way. I guess even many of you out there may have came across it at some of point of time in there life. </p>

     <p>Mandela served 27 years in prison as Gandhi did for India.Moreover, both of them were lawyer and have practiced in South Africa.</p>

   <p> He nevertheless gained international acclaim for his activism, having received more than 250 honors, including the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Soviet Order of Lenin and the Bharat Ratna. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, or as Tata (“Father”); he is often described as “the father of the nation”,just like we described Mahatma Gandhi as “father of the nation”(India).</p>


   <p>  Now,when Mandela is not between us,i believe a void as been created in world which cant not be filled by anyone.Many people have fought for what they felt was right, and succeeded … today we lost one such !!.Now the diamonds of South Africa will not shine that much, flowers will not smell that good…!!! </p>

   <p> I feel so privileged to be born during that era when Mandela was alive.At last that chapter which i read around 7 years ago is concluded.!!.</p>
