<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well</strong>.....all of us must have seen in our day-to-day life that, whenever our mum brings new broom, it sweep's better than the old one, having said that does it really mean that the same principle will be applied to the fast growing political environment around us with <strong>Loksabha 2014 Elections</strong> are knocking on the door. Let's check out......</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Broom here means the Election symbol of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)...!!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If result's of Delhi Assembly election that took place recently is taken in consideration....then I think yes, new broom (i.e. AAP) will sweep much more votes/seats in loksabha 2014 elections better than any other competing party (Congerss,BJP....etc).It came as a shock to everyone that how can a party which is just 6 months old, with no experience can turn the table upside down. This is something which does not happen so often.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Being not so interested in politics, still I can point out some reasons, why they were able to deliver/sweep so much in so less time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. They gave tickets to the so called mango people i.e. Aam Aadmi of&nbsp;&nbsp; Delhi.</p>
<p>2. They also made it very clear that none of their candidates is having any criminal background.</p>
<p>3. Transparency that AAP had shown is exceptional by giving account of every single rupee that their party got.</p>
<p>4. AAP also raised public issues like water &amp; electricity, which got them public&rsquo;s confidence.</p>
<p>5. The AAP campaigned on a shoe-string budget, with members clad in trade-mark white Nehru caps and&nbsp;clutching brooms,&nbsp;the party&rsquo;s symbol, visiting nearly every residential area in Delhi.</p>
<p>6. It also used innovative strategies as they sought to become a household name like their opponents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7. AAP also benefited from the strong anti-incumbency sentiment against the Congress party, which governed in Delhi and runs the central government.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an excellent start (and for now, that is all that is). The fact that the party managed to prove a lot of us wrong is truly exceptional. This proved that they have the biggest broom in Delhi, which helped them to sweep 28 seats out of 70 &amp; which is really commendable. It also points out that maybe there is still a place for idealism in Indian politics&hellip;!!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s see whether this new broom will sweep as many seats as they did in Delhi on National level (Loksabha Elections) also or not&hellip;!!!</p>
