<p><strong>Its</strong> been a while that Oxford Dictionaries declared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie" title="Selfie" target="_blank">Selfie</a> as the word of the year (2013). Congratulations..!! As a result,our self-obsession would now be part of history lessons.</p>
<p>The word Selfie, typically means a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smart phone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website. World is officially filled with people preoccupied with themselves. I guess we already knew that!</p>
<p>A typical example of Selfie was seen at The Academy Awards 2014 (popularly known as Oscar Awards) when&nbsp;<span>Oscar host Ellen DeGeneres &nbsp;</span>walked into the audience and asked some of her celeb friends to hop in for a Selfie. And Rest is the history..!! That Selfie went to become the most Tweeted pic of all time. Well i would say, that &nbsp;it is a Selfie of Century. No, I am serious. It is!</p>
