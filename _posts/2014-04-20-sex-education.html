<p>Heya.. :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is been a lot of news around the corner regarding <strong>Sex</strong> Education in India after,The <strong>Union&nbsp;</strong><strong>Minister&nbsp;for&nbsp;Health &amp; Family Welfare</strong>&nbsp;gave such a irresponsible statement by saying that <strong>Sex Education is&nbsp;Vulgar</strong>, which he went on to deny afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is Incredible India! &nbsp;:(</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well... if Sex is not vulgar and &nbsp;Education is not vulgar than how the hell Sex Education can be Vulgar...??&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>So, Yes..this post of mine is all about Sex Education.Read only and only if you are in favor&nbsp;of Sex Education otherwise you may find it vulgar.. :P</p>
<p>So better shutdown your system and enjoy your life! :) Thanks!</p>
<p>So here i go...</p>
<p>I have been reading&nbsp;regularly " <strong>Ask The Sexpert</strong>" column in Mumbai Mirror and these are some of the question that i got exclusively for you.</p>
<p><em>'Does sperm donation lead to infertility?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Is it possible to get pregnant the first time you have sex?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Can oral or anal sex cause HIV?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Can you get pregnant through penetrative sex?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Can excessive masturbation lead to pimple growth, increase my body temperature and give me stomach problems?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em><span><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/a3ebfb74f3738a3208723f2b7b8b8618/tumblr_inline_n7yu93Gpux1su2l26.jpg" /></span></em></p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t queries asked by children but by adults (many of them married or about to marry).&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t be possible for children to ask them &nbsp;because to be very frank, nothing of that sort exists. Despite being the second most populous country in the world we simply refuse to talk to our kids/sister's/brother's about sex. This means that most adolescents (10-19) learn about the birds and bees from movies, literature, internet or porn, So i did. &nbsp;And they form many erroneous impressions, some of which last for a very long time...! ( I am not talking&nbsp;about&nbsp;myself..kk ..:P)</p>
<p><strong>The current scenario :-</strong></p>
<p>The current sex education classes are&nbsp;focused&nbsp;on the biological aspects of sex&nbsp;and have separate classes for boys and girls. They usually begin when children are in the sixth class. Premarital sex is a taboo topic and children are told horror stories about how it could lead to abortion which is really bad for the body and abstinence is the only option (These are pure facts..purely..I myself have done the research on current Sex Education System and have read many stories). There are no&nbsp;counselors&nbsp;for&nbsp;children to voice their concerns and usually biology teachers have to double up as sex educators in government schools. The only other topics that are covered are HIV/AIDS and unwanted pregnancies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So what can be done to improve the situation:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, let&rsquo;s talk about sex. Stop being ashamed of it or dismiss it as unbecoming of our culture. We need a strong sex education course designed by sexologists, therapists and psychologists that explains sex to children without being ashamed.</p>
<p>This sex education course would need to:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Start at an appropriate age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Explain the biological aspects of sex.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Explain responsible sexual&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;including equality and free will.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>4. Explain how to deal with first night anxiety or other sexual practices like masturbation.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Allow youngsters to ask questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>6. Prevent sexual harassment.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>7. And lastly quit harking about &lsquo;Indian culture&rsquo;!</strong></p>
<p>So, certainly Sex Education is need of hour.The view that sex education isn&rsquo;t necessary is completely redundant and downright dangerous. &nbsp;It has no place in a freewheeling democracy like India which has over 3000 years of constantly evolving rich cultural heritage. Can our leaders, educators, policy-makers&nbsp;realize&nbsp;that? I have my&nbsp;doubts.</p>
<p>Feel free to raise any question on my post and do correct me if there is some mistake in my facts! :D</p>
<p>Want me to speak on something..?? What is it.??</p>
<p>Thanks for your valuable time. :D</p>
