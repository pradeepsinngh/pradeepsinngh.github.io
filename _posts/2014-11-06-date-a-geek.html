<p>Date a geek.</p>

<p>Because he’s a person who creates. He creates stuff – something crazy, something useful, or something which can change the world.</p> 
<p>Now, wait.</p>
<p>Take a moment to realize that everything you see around you had been created by a geek. Pick anything. </br>Now, you can read along.</p>

<p>Date a geek, because he is full of ideas. If you are talking to him and it seems he’s not listening, don’t be mad at him. He might be inside one of his ideas. Instead, ask him about it. He’ll be more than happy to explain it to you, and ask what you think. Tell him honestly, even if you don’t understand how he might be able to measure someone’s temperature using their phone. He’ll make it simple so that you can see it too.</p>
<p>Ask him questions, a lot of them. That way, he’ll know that you are interested in his ideas, and you are genuinely interested in him. You’ll start making your way into his heart.</p>

<p>He loves his ideas, his dreams, more than anything. Probably even more than you. You come a close second. But that’s not what should stop you from loving him. Don’t make him choose, ever. Because he’ll choose his dreams, his ideas over you any day. But he will love your with all his heart, sincerely. Because you’ll be the only one for him. Share his dreams, his ideas. Better still, contribute to them. Trust me, he’ll make you the happiest girl in the world.</p>

<p>Date a geek, because he is different. He is different from the guys you have dated in the past. Hell, he’s different from most of the guys you know. You won’t find nicely filtered DSLR pictures with his friends at a beach in his Facebook album. Instead, you will find pictures of the events he’s been to, fellow geeks he has met, that Mozilla t-shirt which he got at the last developer summit, or his laptop covered with stickers which say, I love APIs, and My other computer is a data center. Ask him what an API means, or a data center for that matter. He’ll be happy, because he prides on his stickers, and because you are trying to enter his world. You won’t find designer clothes and shoes in his wardrobe, or fancy watches or glares. Instead, you will find subscriptions of OSFY and Digit. He’ll rather spend his money buying a new monitor or a cool keyboard for his workstation than on a lavish treat. If you want to gift him something on his birthday, just get him that ultra-cool SSD hard-drive he just saw on Flipkart, and you’ll make his day.</p>

<p>Date a geek, because he won’t cheat on you. Ever. He knows better. He knows how to treat a girl, even if he’s been rejected by girls all his life who chose a glamorous hunk over him. Just stay besides him, and let him guide you through his world of dreams. He’ll take you to places nobody’s ever been to. When your turn, tell him your dreams. Open your heart out. He will listen to you, intently. He will try to understand you like nobody’s ever had. He will want you to pursue your dreams, create something. He’ll inspire you to be yourself.</p>

<p>Date a geek, because he won’t sit long on a fight. He’ll always be the one to break the ice, because he knows you are far more valuable to him than his ego.</p>

<p>Date a geek because he is a creator. Because he wants to change the world. Because he will someday change the world.</p>

<p>Date a geek because you’ll be his precious.</p>
