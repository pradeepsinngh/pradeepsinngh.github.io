<p> Oh, you reached here. Good Good. Can't wait to listen, what happend next. </p>
<p>If you haven't read the first part of it. Shoot <a href="http://blog.pradeepsingh.xyz/my-experience-with-bangalore.html"> here</a>.

<p>Ohk. tu suno... </p>

<strong>A Watchamn (Achyut, 30 Yrs..something)</strong></p>
<p>It was almost 5 in the evening when i came back from <a href="http://www.rri.res.in/">RRI</a> (after completing all the formalities). I was feeling hungry (very hungry indeed). </p>
<p>Looked for some restaurant where i can have something and trust me there was nothing except Dosa, Idli, Vada & some other south indian dishes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resaon for this i understood after alomst a week or so. Malleswaram is sort of Core Bangalore, where most of the people live are South Indian esp Kannada People. Actually, Bangalore started from this region it self and then went on to became what it is known today (Ya Ya Ya, Silicon Valley n all).
</blockquote></p>
<p>So, mostly you will find everything south indian only. (but later on I was able to find some <a href="https://www.zomato.com/review/KvQyzR">Punjabi/Mumabi Restaurant</a>  <strong> #Buurrraaahhhhhhh</strong>).
 
<p>So, Yes! while I was searching for some good place to eat. I encountered this watchman (Achyut, he was Neapli) standing outside this place which only serves Idli and Vada.</p>
<p>I approched him for the help. And he was more than ready to help. He gave me the address of the couple of place where i can have North Indian Cusine.
I went according to what he said and was more than happy with the food. </p>
<p>And, now after 10 days, we are freinds. We have our evening (7-8 PM) Tea/Coffee together. </p>
<p>He is my guide, and always recommends me place to visit, eat. We also share our stories. His story is very tragic and painful (But, I have never see him sad, not even when he was narrating how he fled from Neapl to Bangalore for search of Job and list goes on n on).</p>
<p>We are really good freinds now. He is married and have two childrens, but they live in Nepal (:-( So sad.). He said, he can't keep them in Bangalore as he doesn't earn much. He visit Nepal once in a Year.</p>
<p> "Life is tough" -- He told me. And said, Sir, you work hard. You have Time and Money. Don't waste both of them. (I was speechless.)</p>

<p> this was little about him. I can go throughout the night. He is so generous/amazing. 
</p> Oh, god. I have so much to speak. Will share some more stories as time will pass. </p>
<p>So, Yes. <strong>ab bhaut emotional hogaya! theek hai. </strong></p>
<p>Go n Sleep.<p>
Do let me know, if you ever had such stories/incidents in your life - <a href="https://twitter.com/nomadic_enggr">@nomadic_enngr</a>. </p>
