<p>Nearly a month done now..and things are now pretty steady..progress on my work is slow.. I hope it speeds up..have got the system working and inserted sample..</p>
<p>Among my travels completed in Bangalore (near Bangalore): Mysore, Mangalore and many other local places in Bangalore.
<p>Mysore was awesome..and so was Mangalore..The most important part of these trips was getting to know culture and food (i am obssesed with food) here at Southern part of India better. It also gave a chance to understand my colleague here better...all of us [well except for the nerdy elec guys ] came from different strata in Engineering..and now we are all really knowing each other..The fun we had in Empire, the drinking..[this one’s for you naval]..and the jokes we crack on each other and on other people..it makes our trip the most enjoyable..</p>
<p>And we must surely be the best planning ppl in Bangalore..special thanks to kanchana for arranging acco so efficiently everytime..and to nandan for guiding us with all the confusing maps..</p>
<p>Among all the fun,..there remains always the responsibility of work and the thoughts about home... well..i guess that’s it for now..</p>
<p>Till later<p>

<p>Dot Dot Dot</p>
