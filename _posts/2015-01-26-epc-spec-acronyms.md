title: The Definitive Guide&trade; to Acronyms in the EPC Gen2 UHF RFID Spec 
categories: [blog]
---

I'm reading the [EPC&trade; Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Generation-2 UHF RFID
Specification for RFID Air Interface](http://www.gs1.org/gsmp/kc/epcglobal/uhfc1g2) ... you know, for fun. Probably the worst part of pouring through this super dry protocol spec is all the acronyms - I'm constantly CTRL-F'ing through the document and losing my place. So I wrote up a list of all the acronyms in a text document and keep it open next to my PDF. 

And because I am "proponent of open source" with nothing useful to open source, I am providing this great service to the world via a Gist. Should you, or someone you know and care about, find yourself also reading the EPC Gen2 Spec, I hope this article is of some value to you.
