<p> <li>You :- I have failed.</li>
<li>Me  :- So, you have failed..? (Oh really!)</li>
<li>You :- Yes, dude.</li>
<li>Me  :- Congratulations! :)</li>
<li>You :- eeehhhhh ?</li> </p>

<p>Yes, you got it right. Congatualtions on you failure. <strong>Sweetie! Muuaaahhhh </strong>. You have no idea what you have achieved.</p>

<p>In short, Failuers are important part of one's life.  </p>
<p><strong> Failure is a Function of Trying</strong> :- <br>
The best way to measure your progress at something is the number of setbacks and “failures” you’ve had. If you haven’t failed yet, chances are you aren’t trying very hard. Failure is the blacksmith’s hammer that tempers the sword of success. </p> <p>If you want to get really good at something, you have to fail at least a few times (I would say many times!).</p>

<p><strong> Failure Builds Character</strong> :- <br> 
If you look at the events leading up to any significant victory, you’ll often discover failure as the biggest motivator.</p>

<p> They teach you how to handle situations. They teach you how to not commit mistake agian and again. They teach you the importance of things (at least most of the time). They make you more hungry. They get you going.</li></p>

So, we can take it in this mamnner!

<p><blockquote style="border: 2px solid #666; padding: 10px; background-color: #ccc;"> And, if you haven't succeed, You have never failed.</blockquote>
</p>


<p>Ohk! So, I am almost done. A small HomeWork for you.</p>

<p>Q.) Tell me the name of that person who have succeed in his life without being failed. (In short, who went on to become bigshot without being a losser/failure).</p>

  <p><blockquote style="border: 2px solid #666; padding: 10px; background-color: #ccc;"> Success takes willpower, intelligence, determination, and grit. But more than anything else, it requires failure. </blockquote></p>
