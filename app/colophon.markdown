## Website
* Website is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) & hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com).
* If it weren't for [Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Source Code of @holman's website](https://github.com/holman/holman.github.com) I'd never be able to do this.
* Using [Compass](http://compass-lang.org/) and brilliant [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/).
* [Source Code of this website](https://github.com/kingsidharth/kingsidharth.github.com) is on Github.

## Design
* Typeface is **Museo Sans** served from TypeKit.
* I don't really like colors on interfaces but that evil blue is #2BA6CB.
* Photographs are either clicked by me or are clicks of me. More on those later. 

## History
- **Version 5.5** - uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/) with design separated from content in `/design` folder.

- [Version 5.0](https://github.com/kingsidharth/kingsidharth.github.com/tree/archive/1211) - used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).

    1. Lucida Grande was the primary typeface.

- Version 0.1 - [4.0](https://github.com/kingsidharth/ks1203) Earlier version of the website used [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) & Thesis Theme Framework.

    1. Typeface usage ranged from Arial (yeah, I didn't know better) to Helvetica (yeah, I know!) and finally settled on Lucida Grande.
