title: At Times so Still 
intro: "This one speaks of a feeling I had throughout my high-school. Like a new world was coming. A world beyond the limiting ideas and thoughtless dogmas of the current world. And bringing that world in reality was a task assigned to me."

At times so still

I wonder, I fear

I swallow, I grow

----

I wonder if I've completed the task

I wonder if I've swallowed the darkness

I fear that a storm will come

So I swallow the darkness around my love

I grown in the name of our holy bond

----

At times so still

Seeing my deeds the people praise

But they are still stuck in olden ways

Sitting in temples they hear the chants

But it's true meaning they don't understand.

----

At times so still

I stand on doorstep of a new world

Unwilling turn back, full of dreams that lay ahead

Lifting my step I gain strength

I prepare for new wars to come

----

At times so still

I sense hidden treasures

At times so still

the world prepares

a new me, a new world - and the stillness before it all unfolds.
