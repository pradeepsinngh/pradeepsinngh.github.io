The enemy strikes, at my very heart

But I stand a constant star.

I protect my love with me a shield.

But alas he broke the sacred bond.

of none but a faithful friend.

The grace fades, the light is gone.

The shadows gulp, my dearest heart.

But in the darkness, I still hope.

That soon enough the grace will rise.

And we will see the dawn together.
