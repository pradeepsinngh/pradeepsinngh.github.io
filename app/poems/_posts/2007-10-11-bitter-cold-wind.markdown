title: Bitter Cold Wind
intro: "Bitter cold winds of winter have always been emotionally uplifting to me. Somehow it makes me feel at home. Like the road is my home, and travel is my sleep. But of course this one talks about deeper things than that."

The sun rises in the east

and the journey begins

I start on the path

not knowing where it ends

All the paths that shall be trod

are at the mercy of my lord

but they might not show mercy to me

**The wind is bitter cold**

**and I prayed it to be so.**
