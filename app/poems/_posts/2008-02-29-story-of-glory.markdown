intro: "I hope I wrote this one! Found it in my old diary. It does speak to my expectations and promises to myself. So must be mine. I guess."

Look there's a star

very bright and far

And it tells us a story

of all the men of glory

And I feel I am awaited

A place for me is created

----

I will wave my hand at you

You shall wave yours back at me

And of all the stories that abide

Ours will be one that survives.
