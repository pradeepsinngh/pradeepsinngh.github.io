title: Somethings I've Never Told You
intro: "Though I might come out as an extrovert but most of my emotions (specially love) is seldom expressed. And usually it's too late when I finally say the things that I've never told anyone."

I've told you my secrets

I've told you my lies

But there are 

Something I've never told you

At times you say things

that make me cry

but then I see innocent you 

and I give in to the cute smile

and the tears never get to fall

----

Something I've never told you

When you shout you don't love me

When you shout you don't care

Your shout tells me that you do

----

Something I've never told you

I hug you and drift to sleep

You come in my dreams every night

I wake up with you in my arms

My day starts and end with you

and most of the day, I am thinking of you

----

Something I've never told you

You may call it a lie

But I see so much love in your eyes

I love it when you fight

I love it when you shout in rage aloud

I love every bit of you

And I know that you do too 

I know you will see it soon

Thus I never told you
