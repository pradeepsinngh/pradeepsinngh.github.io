title: The True Lie 
intro: "At times it's so obvious that someone you love, loves you too. So what keeps them from admitting it? Saying it? Why the distance? Turns out it's nothing more than internal conflicts."

Killing me softly, those eyes of an angel.

Keeping me alive, those acts of a devil.

----

You know I love you and I know you do too!

So why this distance in between?

----

Distance of just a step apart

from your side

and yet it's so far.

----

I cannot cross and come over

you never let me

and you never come over

----

So why those secret smiles?

So why those provoking lies?

So why those love filled eyes?

----

We are so close, I can hear you breathe

Oh yes you breathe too loud

And yet we are so far that I can't hear you shout

"I love you too!"

----

Oh Stop this non-sense, stop this pain

Stop this maddening treacherous game!

Just stab me with a knife instead

and as I die, say that lie

which I know to be true

say "I love you"
