Three Seedlings found life

----

First fell in water

No soil, no air, no sun

Water gave it life 

And killed it too. 

----

Second fell in a farm

Fertile soil, measured water

Bred to Yield

Yielded & Died.

----

Third fell in a jungle

Roughest of wilderness 

Lived and died in the wild

Had the time of his life.
