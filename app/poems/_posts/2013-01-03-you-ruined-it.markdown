title: You Ruined It!

---

I was perfect the way I was

One little man, One big cause

Then you came along and ruined it all

I saw your eyes and I fell for you

---

My heart became warm, a beating beast

My soul came alive, full of dreams

I found something they call life

You came along and did this all

---

Roads became beautiful

Trees grew green

Fragrance in flowers

Depth in me

My lil heart, infested by you

---

What a terrible disease!

What a dreadful sin!

You made me endure, so much delight.

---

I was perfect the way I was

Optimist mind, A hopeless heart

Then you came along and I made a mistake

You came along and I kissed you

Since then I've loved you

---

What a beautiful mistake

What a delightful sin

Come along my love, let's do it again!

---

I was perfect

the way I was

And you made me

incomplete.
