title: Life - A Treasure Hunt

Since time forever

I have known this

This weird life of mine

would be one treasure hunt.

----

Promise of a priceless treasures

limitless glory

endless joy

and hints along the way

----

I've trod the paths that never were

they appeared as I walked

disappeared as I passed

to be followed by none

----

Every step along the way

there were mountains to climb

cliffs to jump

and sights that no one would believe.

I've died and revived countless times.

----

Through darkest nights

and burning suns.

Through harshest roads

and strongest winds.

Through flower beds

and heavenly valleys

I've passed to find 

two treasures -

**One I tread,**

**Another I am.**
