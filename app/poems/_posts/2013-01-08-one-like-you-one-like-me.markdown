Look in every village, every forest

Look up all the mountains, all the desserts

You will never find one like me

The dream you dream beyond good and evil,

That dream, I am.

----

Making a trail in wild weeds

You stumble upon a beautiful rock

It mesmerizes you

That rock, I am.

Look through every treasure

You will never find one like me.

----

On trip to your highest mountain

You meet a casual cook

He fulfills you before you risk your life to climb

That cook, I am.

Look through all hotties and naughties

You will never find one like me.

----

Going through old photographs

You find one lonely click

Makes no sense, tells no story

But you remember, you smile

That photo, I am.

Look through all your memories

You will never find one like me.

----

Looking to find a partner in this crime of life

You fall for a crazy boy

Who will join you in your happiness

Even if you won't!

That crazy boy, I am.

Live a lifetime

You will never find one like me.

----
So lucky...

the beautiful rock that found a keeper

the cook that found a stomach

the click that found an eye

the crazy boy who found a lover

... like you.

I will never find one like you.
