title: "I don't know who I am in Love"
intro: 'I know myself so well. But love makes me a stranger. Who am I when I am in love?'
---

I can't see a thing

Why is it so dark?

I can't hear a breathe

Why is it so noisy?

I don't feel your hands

Where are you lost?

Or is it me who's lost?

I don't know who I am in Love.

-----

I knew who I was

The King of my world

The painter of my dreams

But I don't know who this is

This rich beggar

I don't know who am I in love.

-----

I am no price of charms

or magician of spells

I am no handsome lad

Not a famous poet

Still you love me as someone special

I don't know who I am in Love.

------

I don't know how this tale goes.

A happy ending or a sad note.

I cannot foresee, or read your mind

But I am all yours even when I am not sure

What the hell is that?

What is it that I am saying?

I don't know who I am in love.

-----

How do I look?

Why do I feel you on my skin?

Your breathe on my neck?

Your essence inside me?

Who am I becoming? 

I don't know who I am in love.

------

Lost are all directions

And all sense of logic

Emotions surface and pour down 

As rain on a sunny day

I am all drenched, inside out

Is the world going crazy? 

Or am I going nuts?

I don't know who I am in Love.

------

Who's writing these words?

They make no sense

I cannot relate to myself anymore

Yet I relate to each one of them

I don't know who I am in Love

-----

Your words surround me

You are in the center 

Of my heart and life

It is as if you replace me in myself

I don't know who I am in Love.

------

Please show me a mirror!

No take it away!!

I feel like a stranger

This is not who I am

Please tell me who am I?

I cannot understand

I am in Love.
