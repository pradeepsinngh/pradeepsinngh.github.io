title: Not Grown-up Still
intro: "Dude, grow-upâ€”they said. It's what you're supposed to do, they said."
---

I don't think I am grown-up still

And I don't think I ever will

---

Everyday I grow a little younger

About everything under the sky I wonder

---

Why do the birds fly?

What do they see from up in the sky

Do they like casting the shadows on the trees below?

---

Why is sun so bright in the day?

And why are stars so pretty at night?

Are they playing hide and seek?

---

Instead of judging the shade of red

Who won or lost the bet

We skip around hands in hands

---

Smiles and tears make us look pretty

Hearts matter more then the dresses

Hands in hands we skip along

Dance to the tunes of our own songs

---

Let the whole world be a playground

We go round and round and round and round

Meeting more like us who refuse to grow

---

Hear all stories from around the world

And tell all stories that we've heard

And be a story when we die

---

Hear all songs that people play

Learn them by heart and sing along

And make new songs and spread it around

---

The world is wonderful through eyes of a child

That's where your "God" resides

---

I don't think I am grown-up still

And I don't think I ever will
