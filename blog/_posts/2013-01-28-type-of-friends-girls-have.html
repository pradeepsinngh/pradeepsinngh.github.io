<p>Types of friends a girl has (based on extensive research spanning over four and half years). No offense to anyone ,cmon its meant to be funny.</p>

<p><strong>Type 1 - underwear-buddies</strong> : will roam with them to toilet to bed and every possible place, the only reason of fight is, why u didn't come with me.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Type 2 - one or two guy friends</strong> : who they can call up whenever they need a manlike company as they get strength from them (and they arent comfortable with other guys, so much). </p> 
<p>They will hate hearing I love you from these guys but will torture them telling abt their crushes on other guys, basically they are rest assured these guys will not spell it out and also because the girls themself and there gfs cant digest anything.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Type 3 - Hi-bye friends</strong> : these are the girls who they hate but still whenever they meet they will greet each other and talk to them as if they were desperate to meet them for a decade or so and the talk will be abt nailpolish, earing, dress, etc will ensue. </p> 
<p>And the litmus test for this (if the type2 friend starts praising type3) ;).</p>

<p>Am I right ???</p>
