<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;In</strong> my school, I remember very clearly being called as very different from other&rsquo;s&hellip;!. I know you must be thinking different as in what sense..??? Well&hellip;different here means not so being frank with people (had less no of friend&rsquo;s), was bit shy as well, used to talk less (esp with girl&rsquo;s..Yes it&rsquo;s true.).In short&hellip;. I can say I used to take my own time to get mixed in crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess most of you must have faced the same problem, some might have even faced much more intensified one, few of you might have just ignored it &amp; some might have reacted to it in their own way.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But question bumps out here to be&hellip;.Is it really a big deal to be different..??? Is it good to Different or Is it Bad to be different..???? I mean what exactly it is..?? You know what it&rsquo;s a crap&hellip;.nothing more.<br />Let&rsquo;s take a small example&hellip; Imagine a world where everyone of us are same, in terms of behavior , ascent, the way we look, what we speak, how we speak and when we speak, what we like &amp; dislike and blah blah blah........&hellip;etc.</p>
<p>In short all of us are carbon copy of each other. Life would have been so boring..rite.?? Ask this question to yourself..?? I guess all most ,all of you will get the same answer, &ldquo;YES&rdquo;. Everyone will run behind the same girl or boy (Boyfreind/Girlfreind),everyone will have same parents&hellip;and the list of same things that all of us will be sharing goes on n on n on n on&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Does any of us want that to happen..well i have doubt about that..<br />So, the conclusion here is, as &ldquo;It is good to bad sometimes&rdquo; but &ldquo;It is good to different every time&rdquo;&hellip;.at least most of the times.Be happy about what your are...!!</p>
<p>So are you different...??????<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/e32fc0342259b88f4d3eb3b4cd6e2964/tumblr_inline_my1dmuUTOM1su2l26.jpg" /></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>If yes....so proud of it..!!</p>
