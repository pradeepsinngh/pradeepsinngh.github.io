<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know many of you must be busy&nbsp;(and tensed too) with your admission and all..You ppl will be starting a new venture within some weeks called as College Life! &nbsp;But don&rsquo;t worry keep calm and go easy. I&rsquo;m pretty sure all of you will make out into good colleges. So, let&rsquo;s cum to the point. From last one week I&lsquo;m helping my cousin in her admission procedure and had lot of debate at her place among family members on &nbsp;<strong>College VS Courses Dilemma!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/49708eb87e423cd1e2bd076de96e8435/tumblr_inline_n7oqnqR8qu1su2l26.jpg" /></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know some (actually most of u :P) of you must be facing the same problem. Well most of us do come across it at some point of our life and even I did. So, I thought why not help you people with this. As a result I came up with this post specially for you..Yes you only!&nbsp; :D</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securing a seat in Reputed University/College is a common aspiration of a large number of high school pass outs, and they also face a common dilemma &ndash; whether to take up a course of their choice from a lesser &ndash; known college or to settle for a course in which they might have little or no interest in from a more popular college.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This dilemma intensifies further for the students scoring an average result of say, 80% to 90%. Yes, this is an average score according to the cut-off trends of the past few years (esp in University like Mumbai, Delhi and Pune). These students constitute the unlucky lot that missed out on the 90% - 95% mark, despite having been bright in school, and also their shot at the more reputed colleges of the University.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are of course students who have the intelligence and luck to score 95+% and above. They are the privileged ones who get the opportunity to obtain the college and course they desire. This is in stark contrast to the ones scoring 80% or below who neither get their desired course, nor college,and end up having to make a heart-breaking between the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to me, one should choose a course of their own choice over a good college because, courses give you upper hand on your career, they will by default work hard and ultimately performance matters. If one compromises on the course they might land up being dissatisfied in their professional lives too. The college name does not matter. A good college may have good facilities, faculty and a good academic environment allowing healthier competition, but it is up to the student how he/she makes the best of what he/she has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When applying for Master&rsquo;s, admissions are based on entrance exams rather than the college from which a student pursued his/ her undergraduate studies so again college doesn&rsquo;t matters. For non-professional courses, a focused student should choose course over college as these are niche areas where much higher level of study is required in future. There is always a chance to shift to a better college at postgraduate level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Yes..!! For professional courses like engineering and law, a good college opens up job avenues. There is no point choosing a college where campus recruitments are rare or none.&nbsp; Apart from guaranteed placements, a &ldquo;good&rdquo; college also provides major facilities like a well-equipped library, easy internet access or state of the art laboratory. It organizes academic and non-academic programs which enhances the knowledge of students in diverse fields and makes them better equipped to face the world. Since good colleges only take the best of students, the crowd itself is enriching to the newbies and proves advantageous to their overall personality development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hence, there isn&rsquo;t one definite solution to the course v/s college dilemma and it is for the student to decide what matters to them &ndash; course or college and which should be given preference over the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, with this I close my post. I hope it was beneficial for you. If not do tell if I missed out anything. Till then Cya!</p>
