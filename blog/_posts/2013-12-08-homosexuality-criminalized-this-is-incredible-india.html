<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>W</strong>e Indian usually feel very proud of our culture,rules &amp; regulations,laws (Constitution of Indian) and many more things... And we see many Indians taking about India on regular basis, speaking about its diverse population &amp; no of languages &amp; caste which exist here,still we stand united....,love between people of different religion,caste and many more issues and topics....!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in a nut shell the crystal fact that comes out of these discussions ,speeches is that "India is a Incredible Country", India is a great country,no doubt about that but do we really think that India is going in right direction....?!?!?!?. This question has many answers, even my this post also point towards one of its answer.</p>
<p>So the question is,<strong>"Is India really Incredible..???"</strong></p>
<p>As of now,its s a big <strong>NO</strong> to India.....recently (11th Nov,2013) Supreme Court of India overturned the historic Delhi High court verdict, which makes<strong> Homosexuality A Crime Again....!!</strong>.Earlier,Delhi high court(In year 2009) had said that.. "homosexuality is not a disease or disorder".It then overturned the Section 377 of IPC (Section 377 of IPC says.. "Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man or women or animal"can be punished up to life.) and decriminalized the homosexual sex.But recently the Supreme Court dealt a cruel blow to many homosexual's living in India &amp; re-criminalized homosexuality.As a result it brings back the law of discrimination which was created 150 yrs ago...by our ancestors.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are &nbsp;83 countries where homosexuality is a crime..now after adding India the counts goes up to 84.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has led to many agitation led by activists, NGO who support gay and homosexual people against Supreme court verdict in last few days.More over,it has putted a question mark on India's so called image of being a democratic and Liberal country.And as a result the respect that India holds on international level came down drastically.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In my personal opinion its a very big setback to Indian society, in short its a setback to the soul of human beings and i will call it as a black day for the humanity as everyone have their right to choose their partner, their lifestyle,their love...n etc.It seems Supreme Court judgement is a step backward towards untouchability&nbsp;and discrimination days which used to prevail long back here.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The only ray of hope that came during all this was UPA's (Government of India) view towards this verdict (Most importantly the view of the President &amp; Vice President of Congress Party Mr Rahul &amp; Mrs Sonia Gandhi,as they have the max n highest stake in gov) and their will to amend 377 through the common consensus in Parliament.I wish congratulate to Mr Rahul Gandhi for coming in public and putting his point of view on this verdict.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With lot of thing's happening in today's world (Elections have taken place in 4 states,Lokh sabha Elections are on the door,Winter session of Parliament is going on...Anna Hazare&nbsp;is sitting on fast,lot of drama is being created in Delhi..where no one have clue who will form gov..),Government stand &amp; their will to fight against the ban on gay sex &amp; of courses to change 377 of IPC could go unnoticed</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the courtrooms, homosexuals in India still await their date with freedom.But as of now,&nbsp;<strong>We are not Incredible...!!</strong></p>
<p>Let's wait and watch for &nbsp;the best.</p>
