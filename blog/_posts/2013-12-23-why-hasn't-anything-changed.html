<p>They say girls wear provoking clothes and then suffer but how could a mere 5 year old girl provoke you? Our government doesn't give a blind eye to such problems! Even the rapists of nirbhaya's case have been hanged,still people are not able to get a simple thing.  Why don't the parents of these rapists come into light and apologise for their sons deeds? don't they feel creepy? Don't they feel awful of their son doing such a sin! In country like India, where  we literally worship girls with so many festivals,  commit such heinous crime! 
<p>Where's the humanity!? </p>
<p><strong>CHANGE!</strong> <br>
First the mindset of all those Men needs to be changed who think that they Being a Man can do any damn thing in this world,who blindly believe in the fact that they are men and can dominate everyone and women are just for their fucking pleasure. </p>

<p><strong>Please!</strong> <br>
The Female who gave you birth,who is your wife even your daughter,if you look them with respect then why is it to so hard to give the same respect to all the other females in our country?&nbsp;</span><br /><span>If pleasure is all you desire then go to those red light areas! Stop being such bastards ! If you have the audacity to commit such a crime then why don't you accept the verdict of the court,why do you even care to hire a lawyer? Didn't you realise all that before raping that girl? Stop being a coward,why don't you be a man NOW?</span><br /><span><br /></span><span></span><span>Was that minors fault that she was friendly with the neighbour? Why aren't people scared of the law yeah cause they know Nothing would happen to them and they'll be free again and raping other women!&nbsp;</span><br /><span><br /></span><span></span><span>People will again protest but nothing will happen even now,everything is just futile in our country now.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><strong> Today i feel so helpless..Its a helpless India now..!!</strong></p>
