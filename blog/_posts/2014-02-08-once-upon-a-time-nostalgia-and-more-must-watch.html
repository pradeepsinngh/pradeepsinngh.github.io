<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> T</strong>his is the tenth time I am watching the "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHGDN9-oFJE" title="Google Search : Reunion" target="_blank"><strong>Google search :reunion</strong></a>&rsquo; ad and still it manages to make me shed a tear with a smile on my face.The story-telling set in the times of partition and what people went through as they got &nbsp;separated from &nbsp;their place and people of origin gets brilliantly reflected in the advertisement.The story is narrated by a grandfather and a historical event is almost witnessed and understood by the granddaughter.&nbsp; Since the ad has gone viral and the entire world has seen it, I will not further describe it and rather would ask you to watch it if u haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>orget for a moment that the video you&rsquo;re about to watch is an advertisement. Think of it instead as a short film, and just watch. The video runs only 3 minutes, 32 seconds. If you&rsquo;re not in tears, or at least misty, when it ends, then you have no soul.</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>he gist is this: a man in Delhi tells his granddaughter about his childhood friend, Yusuf. He hasn&rsquo;t seen Yusuf since the Partition of India in 1947, when India and Pakistan became separate countries and the two friends were forced to separate. The man&rsquo;s granddaughter arranges for the two to meet again.</p>
