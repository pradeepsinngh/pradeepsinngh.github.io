<p>A surprising number of people fear being alone. Maybe just about all of us do to some extent.</p>
<p>We fear being without a partner, or friends and family. We fear traveling alone in strange places, lost without anyone to ask for help. We fear taking on life without help, for fear of failure.</p>
<p>This is natural, this fear of being alone. We&rsquo;ve all felt it, deep within us, though we try desperately to avoid this fear.</p>
<p>And this is the cause of our misery: to avoid this fear of being alone, we will socialize endlessly, including on social networks and email. To avoid being alone, we&rsquo;ll end up with someone who isn&rsquo;t really good for us, just to have someone to cling to, someone to rely on. We&rsquo;ll eat junk food or shop to comfort ourselves, because these things are replacements for love.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the secret: being alone is empowering. The quiet of being alone is joyful.</p>
<p>We tend to see aloneness as bleak, depressing, scary. But it can be seen as freeing, as an opportunity for growth, an opportunity to get to know yourself.</p>
