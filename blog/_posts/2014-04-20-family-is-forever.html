<p>In the years of your life when you&rsquo;re growing up from a child to an adult, you take almost everything for granted. That time you&rsquo;re kind of stuck in a very artificial, a very materialistic world around you. That materialistic world is actually something you find pleasure in. It sort of provides the growth you need in life &ndash; financial growth. Little do you realize that money is something you anyways ought to earn but what about the emotional growth, the psychological growth? You are happy since you feel that you are lucky enough to make it big in life. Everything is happening exactly the way you want it to be. You&rsquo;re happy being a free spirit until one day when things start to change.</p>
<p>You start to realize that life isn&rsquo;t that simple. The world is a mean place. You start feeling that pain which a lot of people were having all along but you didn&rsquo;t realize they did, since your world was perfect. That is the time when you start counting your blessings and you finally realize that you were lucky all along, and you could remain a free spirit not only because of who you are but mainly because you are blessed with a family that never left your side. A family that chose to accept you exactly the way you are, and let you fly. A family that loves you so much that you never ever had the need to search for love outside. A family that is your life.</p>
<p>You grew up from a baby to a child, and then to a teenager and finally an adult. You came across all kinds of people &ndash; good, bad, and the ugly. You had experiences that left you wondering about life and its complexity, also sometimes about its beauty. The dynamics you had with people constantly changed since people are materialistic. But one thing that remained constant throughout was the connection, the dynamic and the bonding you had with your family. That just didn&rsquo;t change and if at all it did, was for the better. In fact it was for so much better.</p>
<p>Every moment no matter how awesome or disgusting , your family stood by you. Took your happiness as their own, took your achievements as their own, and took your strife too, as entirely as their own. When the world left you to fend for yourself, your family provided you with the warmth that gave you so much of comfort; you forgot all your misery. When the world judged you for being different, your family celebrated that difference and taught you to stand out every single time. It taught you to be at a spot in your life which people crave for. That was the time you felt so grateful and wondered every single time &ndash; what would have you ever done without your family?</p>
<p>You felt that &ndash; yes now you&rsquo;ve finally grown. You start drawing comparisons to people entering in your life. The more you think about your family, the more grateful you feel for them having you in their lives, at a place so special that just cannot be substituted. A place they proudly let you own. A place they will never give to anyone else. That is the time you know for sure that the place you have for your family will also. never ever be substituted. Nobody in the world can take that spot ever. It can never be worth it to share that spot. That spot is for your family exclusively. The more you love your family, the less is the need to understand the world around since it isn&rsquo;t worth it. Never was, never will be. The world at large is a selfish place. But my world comprises my family and that is beautiful. So damn beautiful. Don&rsquo;t really care what the world outside is up to. Let it remain mean. Let it never understand you. Let it test you. Let it give you all the pain. It&rsquo;ll just make you stronger.</p>
<p>Who needs the world when you have a kick-ass family with a support system that is rock solid? I owe my family everything. My folks are my world&nbsp;<span class="wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a place to go &ndash; is a home. Having someone to love &ndash; is a family. Having both &ndash; is a blessing.&rdquo;</p>
