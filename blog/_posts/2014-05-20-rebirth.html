<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>My absence from my own blog has to go down as one of the greatest examples of&nbsp;procrastination. I always kept searching for a topic to write but that is no reason. </p>
<p>But I promise that from now on ya&rsquo;ll will be hearing more from me. The sole reason being University Semester exams. Mumbai University&rsquo;s semester exams are a month long (literally) and with the summer break for other students, you often wonder as to how did you end up in the Engineering field. </p> 
<p>All thoughts related to the ongoing Semester exams lead to the &lsquo;Why did I opt for Engineering?&rsquo; thought.</p>
<p>As it happened today, I woke to learn that my folks weren&rsquo;t at home. I was free to do whatever I wanted. Put an Elvis track on the System, poured a cup of coffee and grabbed a slice of the leftover pizza. Leftover Pizza is the best thing that ever happened to mankind since the invention of wheel. </p> 
<p>So I was having a blast and just then I realized that tomorrow I have an exam for which I hadn&rsquo;t even started preparing. And I eventually ended up with the&nbsp;'Why did I opt for Engineering?' thought.</p>
<p>Gotta go now, study a bit. Ya'll know how University exams are. See ya'll soon.</p>
