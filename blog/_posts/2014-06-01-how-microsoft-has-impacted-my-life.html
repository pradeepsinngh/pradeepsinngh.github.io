<p>Hey folks! :)</p>
<p><span>I am Pradeep Singh and I am pursuing my B.E in Electronics and Telecommunication at University of Mumbai.</span><span> The following is about how I grew up during the age of </span><span><em><strong>Microsoft&rsquo;s</strong></em></span><span> rapid technological progress and how I have been fascinated with the intricacies of Microsoft&rsquo;s technological innovations.</span></p>

<p><strong>How Microsoft has impacted my life !!!!</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Microsoft</strong></em>&rdquo; the one company that had made my life, and I may say a billion others, interesting with its enthusiastic and innovative ideas. It had played a big part of my life as I was growing up and still is making an impact. I was first introduced to the world of computers when I was 7 years old,Since then i am using <em><strong>WINDOWS</strong></em> &nbsp;and have seen the Windows growing over the period of time into a great product with great GUI<span>. I personally used Windows 98(which was first installed in my system) to Windows 8(which i am using currently) every experience is great and i hope the same is with most tech users.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong><span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Some other Product by Microsoft which made my life..!!</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Microsoft Visual Studio :</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="skimlinks-unlinked"><span>Now, if you ask me which is the most </span><em><strong>powerful IDE</strong></em><span> for building applications is be it a Website, Web Application, or a Web Service, the answer would be incontrovertibly </span><em><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong></em><span>, which is a stable standardized, mature, and secure environment.</span></span></p>

<p></p>
<div><span>If I have to point out an IDE, that enables me to write, debug, deploy and test applications, that would be MS Visual Studio as Integrating Visual Studio with Team Foundation Server and Project Server makes the &nbsp;application development, deployment and testing &nbsp;as easy as can be.</span></div>
<div><span><em><strong>This is where I got connected to Microsoft because all this can be achieved seamlessly at one place, which is none other than </strong></em></span></div>
<div><span><em><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio.</strong></em></span></div>
<div><span>And the Latest Visual Studio Pro Update 2 is like anything..!! Microsoft at its best.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span><strong>Microsoft Office</strong> :</span></div>

<p>Building on the partnership with Nokia announced in February 2011 and the increasing success of Nokia&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span>Lumia&nbsp;</span>smartphones, Microsoft aims to accelerate the growth of its share and profit in mobile devices through faster innovation, increased synergies, and marketing.</p>
