<p><span>The rains have finally descended to rescue Mumbai from its rather long sweltering heat. As the rain washes the city anew, here&rsquo;s a list of spots to enjoy Mumbai&rsquo;s monsoon to its fullest!</span></p>
<h2>1. Marine Drive:</h2>
<p><span>Almost synonymous with Mumbai itself, Marine Drive is the place to be at in the monsoon. Remember the scene towards the end of the movie, Wake up Sid? When Aisha&rsquo;s standing at Marine Drive, drenched in the rain and gazing at the horizon? Now you may or may not have a Sid chasing you there but a walk along the Queen&rsquo;s Necklace (as it&rsquo;s fondly called) and a cup of Mumbai&rsquo;s hot steaming cutting chai, is a romance you won&rsquo;t want to miss.</span></p>

<h2>2. Bandra Bandstand:</h2>
<p><span>An alternative to Marines, the restructured Bandstand Promenade has the vast expanse of the Arabian Sea and homes of the who&rsquo;s who of Bollywood on either side of it. You can climb a little higher on the ruins of the fort and get a fantastic view of the sea and the city. And while you&rsquo;re at it, you can also check the &lsquo;</span><strong>Walk of Stars&rsquo;</strong><span>&nbsp;which showcases the handprints of famous Bollywood stars.</span></p>

<h2>3. Carter Road, Bandra</h2>
<p>This stretch across the sea is an ideal walk in the rains, with the Arabian Sea in much verve on one side and glittering cafes on the other. While the promenade is a strip, full of views you don&rsquo;t want to miss, you might also run into a Bollywood star here, since this is the address of many such sparkling residences.</p>

<h2>4. Juhu Beach:</h2>
<p>If you like the comfort of warm food in the rains as you take a stroll by the beach, then this is the place for you. The chaat corner at the entrance of the beach has almost every kind of street food you could ask for. Spiced &lsquo;<em>bhutta</em>&rsquo; or corn on the cob is a must have here during monsoons!</p>

<h2>5. Worli Seaface:</h2>
<p>With a picturesque backdrop of the Haji Ali Dargah, Worli fort and the Bandra-Worli sea-link, it is known for its high tides that manage to soak anyone standing near the promenade. It sees comparatively less visitors during monsoon which makes for an ideal place if you&rsquo;re looking for some solitude. You can also take a drive on the beautiful Sea link which is lit up magnificently at night.</p>

<h2>6. Gateway of India:</h2>
<p>This heritage structure stands tall in its glory as the rains gushes over it. Though it never fails to mesmerize all-round the year, the high tides during monsoons splashing over it and everything around has an endearing charm of its own. Take a walk along the seams or enjoy the view with a nice cup of coffee at one of the caf&eacute;&rsquo;s nearby.</p>

<h2>7. Manori Creek:</h2>
<p>Manori is a quaint little village by the creek and has a sprawling beach which is reminiscent of the beaches of Goa. Within the city but devoid of its noise, this sea shore provides a quick getaway from the city rush. The drive to this place takes a little above an hour but is totally worthwhile as you can see the transition from the concrete buildings to the mud houses cropped between green landscapes.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there are food shacks lined along the beach which has some scrumptious seafood to offer and a ferry ride that takes you to Essel World and Water Kingdom; to the childhood love of fun rides. What more could you ask for!</p>

<h2>8. Powai Lake:</h2>
<p>Surrounded by hills, Powai Lake is an artificial lake in the northern suburb of the city. Nestled in lush greenery and ample flora and fauna, it is an excellent place for a quiet walk in the rains. There are boats too that take you on a ride; the scenery is quite soothing from the middle of the lake. Likewise, you can relax at the Powai Lake Garden and get some hot snacks to enjoy the rains with.</p>

<h2>9. Kanheri Caves:</h2>
<p>A cluster of old Buddhist caves might not exactly be your idea of a monsoon trip. However, these caves situated in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park are located on a hilly terrain which requires a good climb. Add to that, the natural surroundings, the clacking of birds, the gushing noise of the streams and you&rsquo;ve for yourself the perfect trekking spot right in the middle of the city. For the history buffs, the caves are a plus otherwise they could sever as a nice picnic spot!</p>

<h2>10. Madh Fort:</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been a big fan of the popular TV series CID or have caught enough episodes of it, you would recognise this place instantly. Yes, it&rsquo;s the place where the CID team usually plays the game of catch with the bad guys, which almost always ends in Daya slapping the culprit and directly cut to the bureau where he confesses. Always.</p>
<p>Also called the Versova fort, it overlooks the long sprawl of the coastline and the Marve beach. However, it is under the control of the Indian Air Force due to the proximity of the Naval Base and so needs permission to access. Since the Aksa beach is quite near, you can have a stroll by the beach and still see the fort up close in case you can&rsquo;t acquire permission.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Maratha Mandir:</h2>
<p>For the romantics, what better than watching the classic Bollywood love story in the monsoons? The Maratha Mandir is the only theatre which holds a record of screening a movie for longest time. The Epic DDLJ has been screening here for 18 years and still running. Watch it in this heritage theatre and as the movie&rsquo;s tagline goes&hellip;&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;Come fall in love&hellip;all over again&rsquo;.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>These places are a treat to the eyes in the monsoons but if you really want to experience the crazy rains in Mumbai catch a local train. Hop into one during the non-peak hours and see the city pass by glistening in the rains.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to carry an umbrella or a raincoat along with you. Or better yet, forget it!</p>
<p>Enjoy these locations and get socked in Mumbai Rains! And..Yes take care of youself.</p>
