<p> YAY, <strong>Say No to Bitch</strong>.</p>
<p> Shout louder and louder. And, Say No to Bitch. </br>
#TCS, #Infosys, #Accenture, #Wipro, #Cognizant &amp; the list goes on &amp; on... </p>
<p>I consider all these IT Companies (<strong>the so called Mass Recruiting Companies- MRCs</strong>) a Bitch. </p>

<p>And, I know some of you also feel the same &amp; some of you might not.</br> Accepted! </br> Those who don't, I will make you (I will try my best).
</p>

<p>Let's assume you have joined one of these MRCs. Ohk. Now, What ?</p>
<p><strong>What you get :-</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are so small </strong>- You're nobody, nobody else knows you, except for your team, not even people whose product you're building.</li>
<li><strong>You are slave </strong>- You can NOT have a opinion/perspective. Just do it the way they say.</li>
<li><strong>You have zero value </strong> - You have no contribution towards growth of company,so for company you're not valuable or maybe little valuable.</li>
<li><strong>You are Prisoner</strong> - Bonds with high compensation.</li>
<li><strong>You will be paid less</strong></strong> - Less salary.</li>
<li><strong>You will not grow</strong> - Less Hike / Raise.</li>
<li><strong>You will kill time</strong> - You will spend more time with MS Excel than your soulmate. (Fact) :D</li>
<li><strong>No Exposeure</strong> - No or very less exposure for most of the employes.</li>
<li><strong>You are Mediocre</strong> - No Zeal, No Hard work will make you the person, you may like, but you're a mediocre.</li>
<li><strong>You will be a kid</strong> - You will have to go through Written paper (very boring), Personal Interview &amp; series of stupid courses to get a joining letter as a trainee who again have to go through maybe 1 yr. of training, to be able to do stuff you never want to.</li>
<li><strong>You will be losser/failuer</strong> - There are many Chemical, Mech, Civil Engineers recruited for MRCs Imagine you're working with people who failed their stream/passion &amp; going for something they never could relate to.</li>
<li><strong>You will work on stupid projects</strong> - You will be part of a products like these (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sbi.erupee&hl=en">State Bank Buddy - Android Apps on Google Play </a>) created by Accenture <strong>(Accenture is a True Bitch)</strong> whereas you could have done something awesome.</li>
<li><strong>You will work in past</strong> - Working with dead Technologies or gonna-be-dead ones.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In short, <strong>You will be No One among Someone.</strong> Your time to choose. </p>

<p><blockquote>To be clear I'm talking about very specific companies in this answer which recruit masses, and do IT services, these do not apply to other MNCs and they are anyday better than this.</br>
</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I never worked or appeared for any MRCs, but I do have friends and seniors who are / were working at many MRCs and shared their experiences with me.

<p>I have decided to opt out of placements for obvious reasons. I don't want to work with bitch. </p>
