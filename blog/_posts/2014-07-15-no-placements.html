<p>So, finally I have decied that i will be opting out of Campus Placements. As, I don't see any thing which interest me.
</p>
<p>Well, I am not even clear what interest me. (Such a jerk I'm.) </p>
<p>Well, primary reason is only IT companies comes to my Campus (Do, I have to tell you which are they ?). Well, all those which recruit in masses. (In short, they hire Doneky not Horse). </p>

<p>I have no interest in working with Bitch. </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>They will hire you. </li>
<li>They will teach you some shit technologies (which are of 1980 n 1990). </li>
<li>They will ask you to work on some really stupid projects (Atleast most of the cases). </li>
<li>They won't allow you to change your profile once you have started with something. </li>
<li>There will be very less hike. </li>
<li>You will be working with someone who will be least intersted in anything or everything.</li>
<li>And, I can speak throughout the night. </li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that's not the point. </p>

<p> Point is what do you want to do ? Where is space for your aspirations &amp; dreams ?</p>
<p> I have decided to do what I want to do, not what others want me to do. You can read about it <a href="http://blog.pradeepsingh.xyz/note-to-self/"> here</a>.</p> 
</p>So, get out of the fucking way. I am done with the placements even before it started. <strong>Peace </strong>. </p>
