<p>Four years into my engineering, and I’ve seen almost everyone around me going gaga over certificates – peers, juniors and seniors alike. And all kinds of certificates – certificates of participation in tech events, cultural meetups, college clubs, workshops, seminars, college teams. I’ve seen people literally piling up certificates in their portfolio hoping that a piece of paper certifying they volunteered for blood donation three years back increases their chances of getting into that hotshot IT giant.</p>

<p>Sadly, <strong>No</strong>.<p/>

<p>I’m not really a big fan of the Indian education system, and I find this really funny. Why can’t people bother to look from the other side of the grass before indulging in this mindless rat-race? Everyone wants to be certified. But these certificates aren’t worth a dime if the skills being endorsed do not relate to the job description. And even if they are, nobody would rely only on a certificate as a seal of trust. You’re actually gonna have to know the stuff. For Pete’s sake, why would a company offering to hire you as a developer care that you were the best dancer in your branch? <strong>Common sense!</strong> <p>

<p>Now, I don’t speak without proof and validation. Some of my freinds participated in n no of events (technical,cultural), held in &amp; outside college. They do quite well, and are always able to get this cool piece of paper to validate it. Holy moly! This would definitely get us that cool job, no? Wrong again. While they had many certificates, they told that the interviewers didn’t even look at it. <strong>Such a shame!</strong></p>

<p>I seriously hope us Indians to rise above this dogma. Stop running behind certificates, people. Let’s do stuff. We’ll be better off.</p>
