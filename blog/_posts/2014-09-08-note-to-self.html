<p>Hey Peeeps!</p>
<p>It's been a long time, since my last post. Sorry for that...was very busy these days and will remain for some more time. :(</p>
<p>I am writing this post because of many up's and down that i am facing these days. Seriously, suddenly life has gone on a different track and I don't know where the hell I am heading. So, thought of coming up with something to keep my moral high.So, this post is for me. "Note to Self".</p>

<p>Dear Looser,</p>
<p>"Creativity and art aren't common gifts. Nurture them.</p>
<p>Never lose yourself in the crowd. You are different, and don't let anyone change that.</p>
<p>Share ideas. Make a difference. Because time and people will pass by, but ideas and memories don't fade easily.</p>
<p>Make friends. They are one of the greatest gifts you can have.</p>
<p>Happiness is elusive. Chase it hard.</p>
<p>Not making sense to others is fine. As long as you are sane.</p>
<p>Make the most of everything you have. You cannot make the most of anything else anyway.</p>
<p>Do what you love.</p>
<p>Have fun with whatever you do.</p>
<p>Do not look back. Have no regrets.</p>
<p>Take all you can, give nothing back. Arr !</p>
<p>Happy Reading. :)</p>
