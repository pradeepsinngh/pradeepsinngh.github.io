<p>I remember the early days of my engineering when i used to spen sleeples night trying to fix a bug in different Open Source Projects
<p>Truly speaking, finding a bug for a beginner is really a hard job. I faced the same problems. But i'll be listing down on few steps on, "<strong>How to fix Bugs</strong>" and get started with contributing a large organization.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 1: Select a Project - </strong>
<p>Before you decide to pick any project...think of few things!</p>
<ul type="circle"><li>Are you comfortable with this project's source code?</li>
<li>Can you understand both the code i.e. language(mainly the core compression algorithms)?</li>
<li>And also the,"application", GUI and command line, and also all interactions with the operating systems?</li>
<li>And also the coding style ?</li>
<li>Will you invest your time and effort into this Operating System/Project/etc..?</li>
<li>In short,think many times before taking up any bug</li> </ul>

<p><strong>Step 2: Can you reproduce the bug?</strong></p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>To choose a bug to work on, one needs to be able to reproduce the problem on a similar computer environment.</li>
<li>Choose bugs that are easy to reproduce and easy to fix (atleast for some time).</li>
<li>Is the bug really a bug?</li>
<li>Always try to reproduce it yourself. Don't just rely on other's words.</li>
<li>As a software engineer/programmer, see if you can explain the bug's behavior in terms of your understanding. Sometimes users have unrealistic expectations of how software/hardware systems work and make impossible feature requests.</li>
<li>How do I confirm my understanding? How do I know if it is copying or moving the file?</li>
<li>You'll need diagnostic tools, like Process Monitor. You may also tweak your test machine setup to test different scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Can you locate the code responsible for this behavior?</strong></p>

<ul type="circle"><li>A rough overall understanding of the project is needed.</p>
<li>Locate the code which is causing the bug/issue.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make modifications and see how it affects the program's behavior.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Present your changes to your coworkers/peer developers and get feedback.</strong></p>
