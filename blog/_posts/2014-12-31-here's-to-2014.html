<p>2014 has been such a roller-coaster for me - emotionally and professionally. It taught me a number of lessons, most of them the hard way. Today is the 365th day of the year, and it's fitting that I do a recap.</p>

<p>2014 taught me that <strong>change is truly inevitable</strong>. A no-brainer, really, but I didn't imagine it'd be this intense. A lot of things changed, and I had to let go of a lot of other things that I held most dear. But that's the cycle we must feed into.</p>

<p>2014 taught me that <strong>you should not trust everyone</strong>. Another no-brainer, but I guess I needed a tough lesson this time. I've fallen many a time, and refused to learn. Not this time though.</p>

<p>2014 taught me that <strong>you must trust someone</strong>. You must find, or rather identify, people you can put your blind faith in. As dangerous as it may sound, it's the best of things if you have at least have one such person in your life. I've been blessed with a few.</p>

<p>2014 taught me that <strong>perfection is harmful at times</strong>. Sometimes you just need to set aside your OCD about the little details and set the goddamn ship sailing. Fail to do that, and you'll only be left with a marvellous ship with no waves to ride on.</p>

<p>2014 taught me that <strong>you must believe</strong>. In yourself, and in others around you. Life becomes so simple when you start off just by putting a little faith in everyone around you. In most cases, people do not disappoint.</p>

<p>The most important lesson that 2014 taught me is the one of <strong>bravery</strong>. Bravery in doing the little things that that someone wouldn't even bother. Bravery in persevering through the dark, just because you believe in the light at the end of the tunnel. Bravery in giving a damn about something. The world doesn't give a damn about the pawns at the back of ranks. They celebrate the valiants at the frontlines.</p>

<p>I'm truly grateful for the people in my life, esp to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mohit.tandon.319">Mohit Tandon</a>. For me, this year ends as a reminder to what I have right now, and what I need to achieve in the coming 365 days.</p>

<p>Let's all be great in 2015. Mediocrity is not an option anymore.</p>

<p>-- Happy New Year! </p>
