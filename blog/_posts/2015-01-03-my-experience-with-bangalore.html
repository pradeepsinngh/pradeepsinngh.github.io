<p> As I sit and share my experience about one of my most favorite cities in the world, I'm infused with memories. Bangalore happened to me when i am little less than 21. I came here 10 days back to work on a Research Project at <a href="http://www.rri.res.in/">Ramam Research Institute </a>.</p>

<p> Since then its been a great experinece, professionally as well as personally.</p>

<p> So, my first impression of Bangalore is something which is very different from other citites for variety of reasons. (Oh <strong>NO </strong>, It has nothing to do with <strong>Silicon Valley of India</strong> or <strong>IT capital of India</strong>). </p>
  </p>
  
<p> Rather, its has more to do with the Humans <strong>(Humans of Bengaluru)</strong>. On my very first day, (Yes, 24th Dec 2014) I met these 2 beautiful people, who were more than happy to go out of there way and help me. So here are these 2 small stories. </p>

<p> <strong>A Old Lady (45 - 50 Years) </strong>:-
<p>She was coming back from Pune, where her daughter is living with her husband. We had a small conversation (5 Mins) during Train journey but never thought that she will be so motherly in Nature. </p>
<p>I reached SBC at 9:05 AM and was looking for a Cab/ Auto to commute to the my hostel (Where i was supposed to stay/ And I am currently staying at the same place- Malleswaram). </p>

<p>She came to me :- Where do you want to go? "Malleswaram," I said. <br>
She said (Smiling) :- You better take Bus, its hardly 10-15 Mins.<br>
"No, Mam. It's Ohk. I'll Manage, " I replied. <br>
She said, "come I will take you to the Bus Stop".<p/>

<p>Then, we walked for 2 mins and reached Majestic Bus Stop.

<p>P.S. :- The moment we reached Majestic, I was like what the hell -- I had no idea, what was that. So many buses in so less space. Till, then i didn't had any idea about Bangalore Traffic and congestion problem particulary near KBS/Majestic Area.

<p>She took me to the platform no 22 (In Bangalore, they have platform for Buses also. Strange. Same was with me). And said, you can take any bus from here.
<p>By the time next bus came, she was standing just next to me. Just to make sure, that i take correct bus. How amazing she was. :)
<p>Next Bus came, And i got into it and she waived her hands to say Bye and so did I.

<p>Within next 12-15 Mins, I was in Malleswaram. then I realized, I didn't even said Thanks to her (I felt bad... and I should).
</p>
<p>So, this was my first interaction with these amazing Humans of Bangalore.</p>

<p>Checked in the Hostel, completed all the formalities. And, was ready to report to the place where i was supposed to work for next couple of months (Yes, <a href="http://www.rri.res.in/">RRI</a>). </p>
