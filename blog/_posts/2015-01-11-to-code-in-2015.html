<p>This post is gonna have my list on what I want to code, make, try, learn in 2015. I don’t think it’s gonna end. I’m gonna add more to it. Hopefully I’ll mark them as done too. :)</p>
<p>  <ul type="circle"><li> Fix my already existing projects.</li>
<li>    Contribute to git. </li>
<li>  Contribute to Mozilla OS. </li>
<li>  Learn Ruby.</li>
<li>  Become better at Python. Spread love for Python.</li>
 <li>  More Linux Kernel patches. :D </li> </ul> </p>

<p>Will add to it more and more.</p>
