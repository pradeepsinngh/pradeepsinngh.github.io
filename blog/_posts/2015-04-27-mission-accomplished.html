<p>As I head towards my final semester of Engineering, the placement season is about to over in my campus. </p>

<p>And, unlike most of the times this time i am able to keep up to my excepetaions. Some months back I made it a point to not go for IT Companies (<a href ="http://blog.pradeepsingh.xyz/say-no-to-bitch/">Coz they are bitch!</a>). In short, I decided not to sit for placements. 
<li> <strong>I opted out of my Campus Placements </strong>. To read more about that, Why I did so head over to <a href="http://blog.pradeepsingh.xyz/no-placements/">this</a>.<li> </p>

<p>finally! I am jobless. :D</p>
