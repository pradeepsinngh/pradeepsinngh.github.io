<p>Bengaluru (aka #Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern Karnataka state. The center of India's high-tech industry, the city is also known for its green spaces and nightlife. Near Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha is its massive Neo-Dravidian legislative building. Former royal residences include 19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled after England’s Windsor Castle, and Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak structure.

<p><li>I have been in Bangalore since this June and I am in love with this city for various reasons.</li></p>


<p> <Strong>#1 WEATHER </Strong>

<li>This is one city where you will face a diverse weather. It's neither too hot nor too cold, infact within one day one can feel all kinds of weather.</li>
<li>early morning-winter </li>
<li>afternoon- summer</li>
<li>evening-rainy</li>
<li>night-winter</li>
</p>

<p> <Strong>#2 Trees Trees everywhere</Strong> </p>

<li>Yes, its not called the 'green city' for fun. Its indeed much greener city than other high speed cities of India. The trees which form a canopy specially at Malleswaram (ahem ahem! I live in Malleswaram :D), HAL road etc just makes you feel on top of world.</p>
</li></p>

<p><Strong> #3 The People </Strong>

<li>I have been to Mumbai, Delhi and various other cities but the cultural diversity found in Bangalore is nowhere else. No matter where you are from,you are welcomed here. You would struggle unless you knew the local language in every other big city in our country. </li><li>In Bangalore I've seen people go to extraordinary lengths to try and communicate and help outsiders. Sign language is common, they even throw in a few random words from every other language they know.</li></p>

<p> <Strong> #4 The Food </Strong>

<li>Idlis and chicken tikka co-exist peacefully in Bangalore. If you are the kind of person who's open to all kinds of food and is excited at the prospect of tasting something new maybe its time to find an excuse to move here. You get everything and its tastes magnificent. Continental and street food live in harmony here (yes, alongwith idli and chicken tikka)
and if you haven't stood in queue to eat the south Indian thali at the famous MTR in Mavalli, make sure to go there ASAP. </p>

<Strong>#5 The Places </Strong>

<li>From high end Bars and pubs to ISCON, you can find everything here. </li>
<li>Corner House, MTR, Brigade Road, Church Street, Blossoms, the Iscon temple, Lalbagh, Cubbon Park, Pecos...all this would make sense only to a Bangalorean. I can't begin to tell you about the charm of these places. </p>
</li>
<p> </li>These are the few of the things which I can brag about this mallu city. In my next post I would cover the worst things of Bangalore which needs to be changed (No one is perfect ;-) You know! Pheww).</li>
<p><strong>Disclamer</strong> : Photos used here are not mine. I have collected them form various source from Pinterest. </p>
<li> till then dot dot dot </li></p>
