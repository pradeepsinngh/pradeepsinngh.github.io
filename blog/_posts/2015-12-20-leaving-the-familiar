As and When I make my self comfortable some where, Life throws an exception at me. </p>

<p><em>I wonder Why? Why at me? </em>. </p>

<p>I don't believe in God, so there is no way that almight is having <em>Or</em> planning something big (or good) for me.
</p>

<p>This time the exception is rather good than bad. At least it seems to be. I'm still to figure out this. May be.. time will tell.
</p>

<p>I joined <a href="https://rri.res.in">Raman Research Institute</a> this July to work on 3 projetcs. 
And as part of my job here I was supposed to work here for a year. 
I was slected after my sucessful run as an Research Intern here in Dec 2014. 
Getting this opportunity to work in highly competitve research environment/Labs with state of the art technology and under the guidance of some of the most smartest/inteligent people in India (or may be of the World), I bounced on it & with out giving any second thought I accepted the offer.
</p>

<p> I was working in Digital Signal Processing Lab in Electronics Engineering Group and all 3 projects that i was supposed to work dealt with FPGA & signal Processing. 
</p>

<p>
As part of my work, I was involved in these 3 projects :- </br>
 Development of Signal Processing Algorithms using OpenCL interface in Virtex 7 FPGAs.</br>
 Implementation of 10GE interface using Quad SFPs in Virtex 6 FPGAs.</br>
 Testing methodologies for 8-Tile Digital Receiver System.
</p>

<p> But within some months, came an exception (rather an opportunity).</p>
<p>
One day, out of the blue..I got an email form one of the Prof. from <a href="http://iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a> and email read like this :</p>

<p>
<blockquote>Pradeep, I like your CV and I would like to interview you for an exciting project in collabration with <a href"http://www.isro.org/">ISRO </a>(<a href="http://www.sac.gov.in/sacwebi/sacHomePage.iface">Space Application Center</a>,Ahemdabad).
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>I was quite intimidated. I mean this is proper research. But, having published some research papers earlier & working in research environment already for quite a some time, I was confident.
</p>

<p>And, in next couple of days my interview was fixed. 
</p>
