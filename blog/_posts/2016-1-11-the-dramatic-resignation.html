Well, I was wrong. Life can never be easy for me. Before reading further..go through <a href="http://blog.pradeepsingh.xyz/2016/01/04/the-only-way-I-could-have-ever-gotten-into-IIT.html">this</a>.
</p>

<p>
So, I joined IIT Bombay on 4th Jan 2016 and today (11th Jan 2016) I gave my resignation. 
</p>

<p>Reasons are many..I'm still to figure out, how, when, what went wrong? </br>
But one that comes to my mind immediately is this -
</p>

<p><strong> Overworked</strong></p>

<p>
Often, I was working almost every waking hour - on everything under the sun, from analysing the data to meeting the deadline of a shit International Conference to fixing the Software bugs to reading loads n loads of Research Papers. 
</p>
<p>
Quiet obviously I burned out pretty frequent - Iâ€™d slow down, crash and burn. To a point where my personal life was at stake.
</p>

<p>
Now in Research - this happens. You do all this and it is worth if there is an outcome - if there is a symbiosis. 
But overworking in a parasitic complex is just invitation to death.
</p>

<p>So, I quit.</p>

<p>There is more to say...</p>

<p>But for time being, I jobless again.</p>
