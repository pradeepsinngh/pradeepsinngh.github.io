As and When I make my self comfortable some where, Life throws an exception at me. </p>

<p>I wonder <em>Why? Why at me? </em>. </p>

<p><blockquote>I don't believe in God, so there is no way that almight is planning something good for me.</blockquote>
</p>

<p>This time the exception is rather good than bad. At least it seems to be. I'm still to figure out this. May be.. time will tell.
</p>

<p>I joined <a href="https://rri.res.in">Raman Research Institute</a>, Bangalore in July (2015). 
And as part of my job here I was supposed to work here for a year.
I was slected after my sucessful run as an Research Intern here in Dec 2014 -Feb 2015. </br>
Getting this opportunity to work in highly competitve research environment with state of the art technology and under the guidance of some of the most smartest/intelligent people in India (or may be in the World), I bounced on it & with out giving any second thought I accepted the offer.
</p>

<p> I was working in <strong>Digital Signal Processing Lab</strong> in <strong>Electronics Engineering Group</strong> and all 3 projects that I was supposed to work dealt with FPGA, Signal Processing & Parallel Programmimg. 
</p>


<p> But within some months, came an exception (rather an opportunity).</p>
<p>
So, One day out of the blue...I got an email form one of the Prof. from <a href="http://iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a> and email read like this :</p>

<p>
<blockquote>Pradeep, I like your CV and I would like to interview you for an exciting project in collabration with <a href="http://www.sac.gov.in/sacwebi/sacHomePage.iface">Space Application Center, ISRO</a>, Ahemdabad.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>I didn't replied to his e-mail for 3 days. I was quite intimidated. I mean this is proper research. But, having published some research papers earlier & been working in research environment already for quite a some time, I was confident.
</p>

<p>And, in next couple of days my interview was fixed (Skype). 
</p>


<p>I was excited (and nervous too). Then, came the D-Day.
</p>

<p>And, guess What? </br>
Interview just turned out to be an mere discussion about my past projects, experience, future plans &amp; some questions about Signal &amp; Image Processing.
</br>
Phhheeeww. I was happy. I thought, I made it. Big ISRO dream. :D
</p>

<p>
And, then suddenly Prof. said..You have to come down to Mumbai (IIT-B) to meet me in person. For what..? </br>
Well, for a full fledged interview..? </br>
I was nervous again but ready indeed. Meh.
</p>

<p>
Then, dates were decided. I was asekd to come on 4th Jan 2016 </br>
(My New Year...started with an Interview :()
</p>

<p>But, this time this exception really turned out to be good. I cleared everything and was selcted as Research Assistant. </br>
YAY! </br>
Icing on the cake was my (our) collabration with <a href="http://www.sac.gov.in/sacwebi/sacHomePage.iface">Space Application Centre, ISRO, Ahmedabad</a>.
</p>

<p>So, finally..I have joined my new job. I'm working at <a href="http://iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a> and funded by <a href="http://isro.gov.in/">ISRO</a>. :D 
  </p>

<p>Life changing possibilities are exciting. Peace. :D </p>
