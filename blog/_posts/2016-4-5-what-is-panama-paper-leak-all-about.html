<p><strong>1.) What is Panama leak all about?</strong></br>
Panama Papers (international collaborative project) have leaked the significant documents (approximately 11.5 million documents totaling 2.6 terabytes of data) about Mossack Fonseca firm (an off shore law firm) in Panama (A country in Central America) which has helped investors around the world to evade tax, launder money, among others.

<p>
<strong>3.) What is an offshore law firm? What it does..?</strong></br>
An offshore law firm is a firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world.
</p>
<p>
These shell companies allow their promoters to hide their business dealings. They have dozens of offices all over the world. 
</p>
<p>
Their job is to found, sold and managed thousands of companies and thus making huge profit and helping others to make their black money into white/ evaded taxes. 
</p>
<blockquote>A shell corporation  is a corporation without active business operations or significant assets. Shell corporations are not necessarily illegal or illegitimate, as they often serve an important for potential startups. Additionally, shell corporations can act as a tax avoidance for legitimate businesses. <a href="https://www.google.co.in/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=cFEDV5ncC8_2vQSalIGwCw&gws_rd=ssl#q=what+is+a+shell+corporation" target="_blank"> Source</a></blockquote>

<p>
The law firm helped clients secretly create a maze of accounts to make their money untraceable & thus converting black into white or evading taxes etc.
These companies makes it easy for others to found companies, by selling its shell companies in cities across the world.
</p>
<p>
They provide loads of facilities & at a very cheaper rate, from buying an anonymous company for as little as $1,000 (nearly Rs 66,290), to providing a sham (fake) director, to holding board meetings. And if the clients desire, it conceals the company's true shareholder. In short, the company is into the business of withholding the true identity of the offshore company's owner. 
</p>

<p><strong>4.) What is Mossack Fonseca?</strong></br>
A law firm based out in Panama which sells its shell companies around the world. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160403-mossack-fonseca-offshore-secrets.html">ICIJ likes to describe them as gatekeeper</a> to the secrets of its clients, even those who are crooks, mafioso, drug dealers, corrupt politicians and tax evaders. Mosack Foneca is one of world’s five biggest company when it comes to selling offshore companies. 
</p>

<p><strong>5.) How leak took place?</strong></br>
An anonymous source contacted a <a href="http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/en/" target="_blank">German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung</a> (SZ) over a year ago period and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca datebase. 
</p>

<p><strong>6.) What's the leaked data all about? </strong></br>
The data leaked is mainly comprises of emails, pdf files, photo files, and excerpts of an internal Mossack Fonsecadatabase.
</p>
<p>
It reveals information on how an overseas industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the assets of the world's rich and famous personalities from politicians, FIFA officials, fraudsters, drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes. 
</p>
<p>
It provided a clear picture of how Mossack Fonseca routinely accepts investments/ money from world's rich and famous people to engage in business activities that potentially violate laws of many countries, besides helping and abetting tax evasion and money laundering.
</p>

<p><strong>7.) How big is this leak?</strong></br>

<p><strong>10.) So, is this a fraud case? (from Indian perspective) </strong></br>
Yes, it is. </br>
But, it all depends when they have invested (in which year) & also whether they have informed the authorities about their assets/ earnings in abroad in past or not. 
<p>According to the law if anyone has invested before 2004 is in violation of the law. And, as per RBI, those setting up or buying companies before 2013 are in‘technical’ violation of the act. </p>
<p>If individuals have kept the government informed of their investments/ earnings abroad through these companies, then there is a weak case. </p>
<p>But if the authorities were not informed of the assets held abroad then there are various acts that are triggered, such as the money laundering act and FEMA, among others & they should/ will be prosecuted. </p>

<p><strong>11.) What Indian Govt. had to say on this?</strong></br>

<blockquote>PM Modi steps in: Income Tax, RBI panel to probe Panama Papers trail,"PM Modi has himself requested that this matter be investigated... I think it's a healthy step that this kind of exposes are being made," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, reacting to The Indian Express story. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Indian Govt. have promised to do and full fledged investigation in this matter & the require action will be taken against those who will be found guilty.
