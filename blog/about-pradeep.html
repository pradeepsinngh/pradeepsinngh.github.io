<p>Hello fellow Humans! <br> I like to be called <strong>Pradeep Singh ( प्रदीप सिंह )</strong> which I now find quite nice and bit romantic too if spoken by a pretty girl.
</p>
<p>In my childhood, I did not like my name. It was way too heavy to carry around, esp the <strong>Deep (दीप) </strong>part & when my younger brother was named Robin, it made things more worse for the person inside me.
</p>
<p>Though my life speaks for itself but most of the time it has failures & poor grammar. Following are most of my accomplishments and deeds I’ve done.

<p>The only video game I have ever completed is IGI-2. I have never played Mario-2 but loved Need for Speed - Hot Pursuit. 
I have never ever been accused of Grand Theft Auto. </p>

<p>I have lived in 4 states of India and never been abroad. I contend that I am not running away from anyone. 
<!-- I was in depression for <strike>sometime</strike> some years, when I was dumped by a girl and adding on that, I even waited for her for <strike>sometime</strike> some years. Therefore, I proved bollywood stories are shit &amp; waiting doesn't work always. I do miss here :( (badly). I wish...shhhhhhh. Quite.
-->
<p>I never rode an elephant, donkey or a camel, although in my childhood I did ride buffaloes, cows and street dogs. </p>
<p>I do not know how to swim but dream of swimming across Indian Ocean. I was bitten by a bitch once on my butt when I was looking at her pupies.
</p
<p>I never got sunburns. I can do farming and love visitng Research Institutes, till now my favourite campus in India is of <a href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/" target="_blank">JNCASR, Bangalore</a>, untill I visited the  <a href="https://www.ncbs.res.in/" target="_blank">NCBS, Bangalore</a>.
</p>
<p>Since my childhood, I have consumed more than 8659 liters of cow’s milk. I'm more close to my Mother & still address her as Muma (even though i'm grown up now), which people find quite funny at times & thus making me Muma's Boy (Which I'm not). </p>

<p>I have never played any musical instruments and have stopped singing after hearing my own recordings. I just love Atif Aslam. I used to have trouble with English grammar (in school) and during my pursuit of English, somewhere I lost my grip over Hindi. I’d love to be emotionally bilingual.
</p>
<p>I have more than laymans interset in Computational Neuroscience. If by any chance you are a Historian or Anthropologist, here is my brief history.
</p>
<p>wait..wait..will update my history..till then read <a href="http://blog.pradeepsingh.xyz/timeline" target="_blank">timeline of my life.</a>.
