This<strong> blog</strong> began as an experimental online dump for some of my notes about <strong>entrepreneurship, startups, life, opensource & travel</strong>. Just the act of rewriting the note sometimes lead to notes becoming essays.</p>

<p>Now It has has become a timeline of my thoughts. Some of the old writings bring smile, laughter and at times even clarity. I intend to keep adding new ones once-in-a-while. Also, then there's a list of the <a href="/speaking">talks</a> I've given, thing's I <a href="/read">read</a> <em>&amp;</em> <a href="/write">write</a>.</p>

<p> I've been working with/at startups since I was 19 something. You can find more about me <a href="http://www.pradeepsingh.co.in">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since my first post in <strong>Dec, 2012</strong>, this little website has come a long way.</p>
