<strong>How I Braved Anu Aunty</strong> is not exactly a work of fiction, nor a biographical piece, but somewhere in between. The book cover says &#8216;<em>A true story</em>&#8216; and the disclaimer says &#8216;<em>This is a work of fiction</em>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Perhaps, being a true entrepreneur, <strong>Varun</strong> was trying to break free from status-quo that a book needs to belong to a genre. Also, a great way to market your company. Genius, ya!</p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>Varun, the author and the protagonist, has no job after graduating from an engineering college. So <strong>Anu Aunty</strong> along with his mother and her kitty party gang are hell-bent on getting his life on the track, a track which Anu Aunty deems fit. But Varun has different dreams. This is a story of making of a young entrepreneur. Fasten your seat-belts.</p>

<h3>The Goods</h3>
<p>The story is original. And on top of it &#8211; it&#8217;s not a chick-lit or a crap-lit. It&#8217;s not even about college. That&#8217;s something rare for a young Indian writer.</p>
<p>Varun is a storyteller, and a good one, funny as well! At one point I was laughing like mad, sitting in my room reading the book. My friends wondered if they should call a psychiatrist.</p><p>His remarks and insights on &#8211; the aunty culture in India and almost everything that a young Indian goes through &#8211; are hilarious. A lot of &#8216;ya&#8217;, desi lingo, Bangalore lingo, iconic Indian things like maggi and some side track-startup gyaan &#8211; the book is already steaming.</p>
<blockquote><p>And with that, both ladies started the ritualistic sobbing.... It is the one stop solution for any occasion, good or bad.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There was trouble brewing and the aunties hated it when they were not in tune with the latest gossip.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Bads</h3>
<p>The book starts with a piece called <strong>“Dude, This Guy Can’t Write for Shit” </strong>where Varun makes an excuse that he is not a writer (but a storyteller) so he shouldn’t be judged there.
</p>
<p>Well dude, guess what makes a writer – a writer? <br>
Writing! <br>
And you just wrote & published freaking 200+ page book! So you are a goddammed writer. And I am judging you on it.
</p>
<p>For the most parts – the gyaan (in sans serif typeface) was a very witty way of introducing alien concepts to people, or giving a piece of advice, or simply sharing a random thought. But at times the gyaan part was overdone. Chapters on Steve Jobs and Facebook marketing etc., were not exactly a part of the narrative and could’ve easily gone to the Post Script section of the book.
</p>
<blockquote>We had copyrighted the name though, so if any of you enthusiasts are trying to start your own company with name Backbenchers, watch out.
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you can’t copyright a name; trademark is a different thing. I can almost hear Any Aunty say, “Tsk. Tsk. What Varooon? Lying, ya?”
</p>
<p>Some biases were stupid, if not offensive. Not funny.</p>

<p>At the end, my biggest fear did come true. The conclusion of the book was the biggest disappointment. KLPD. It just falls off from stairs and comes crashing down.
</p>
<h3>Stuff</h3>
<p>The characters were funny, human and mostly comically caricatures &#8211; which fits the tone of the story very well. They will remind you of someone from your own life.</p>
<p>Some little touches and bits are genius. The journey starts and ends at <strong>Noon Wine</strong>. And…</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Kormangala.&#8217;
<br/> &#8216;Two hundred rupees.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>That was genius.</p>

<p><strong>Varun Agarwal</strong> is funny, witty, refreshing, original and captivating story teller. Would love to read more from him.</p>
<p>It was nice to see a fellow entrepreneur telling a story. <strong>There is much need for original storytelling and also startup-storytelling</strong>. I would actually want my friends to read this, maybe they will (finally) understand what I do and not call me a web designer.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s mother of all swears &#8211; Mother Swear.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There are two things you should never do &#8211; ask a girl her age and ask a guy to clean his room.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The peace of my house evaporated suddenly and the innocent walls were forced to hear the darkest secrets of every aunty.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>They watch a lot of porn too.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Bhaiya, come. Mummy ji is crying.&#8217;<br/> I was done.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Are you gay?&#8217;<br/> Lightening. Thunder. Rain And old Hindi movie soundtrack.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are a budding entrepreneur or you have ever come across the Aunty culture or even if you want to read a fresh writng, this is the book for you. I would definitley recommend once. Go ya & Buy ya!
</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> A very nice book cover by <strong>Jezreel Nathan</strong>. An apt over-crowed illustration for an overly long book title.</p></div><aside><p
