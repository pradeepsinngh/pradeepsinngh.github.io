<p>Took this Boot Camp (Workshop/ Talk) for IEEE Student Branch of my college. </br> Talked to budding engineers about Robotics, how Robotics is transforming the scape of Automation and where to begin. </p>

<p> I took this talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/SarthakMarathe">Sarthak</a> (that cute &amp; shy boy!) and he was amazing as usual with his part. </p>
