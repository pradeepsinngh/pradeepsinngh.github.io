<p>Writing is good; editing is profound. I use the writing-editing process to sort, express &amp; play-around with thoughts.</p>
      
<h2>I write here often:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://blog.pradeepsingh.xyz/">94 Notes</a> is a personal timeline of thoughts, where I share my insights on life, startups, entrepreneurship & some random stuff.</li>
    <li>I write a Travel Blog called <a href="http://www.nomadicengineer.in/">Nomadic Engineer</a>. I share stories of people, food, culture of different places from across India.</li>
    <li>I write on Quora too. This is the <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Pradeep-Singh-39/answers">list</a> of my answers on quora.</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h2>Past:</h2>
  I used to write these two blogs in past, but due to my procrastination attitude I had to shut them off. 
  </br>
  Moreover, these day's I'm always preoccupied with many things which leads to no time for these two writings. RIP. But, still I intend to keep writing ones once-in-a-while. 
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Digital Revolution - about Microsoft Technology (Windows in specific), Open Source, How-To-Code & more</a>.</li>
    <li>Electronics Of Things - about Electronics, Embedded Systems &amp; much more</a>.</li>
  </ul>
